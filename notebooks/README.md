# üìì Notebooks

This folder contains the **final notebooks** used in our participation in the **TSAR 2025 Shared Task**.  
Each notebook documents the workflow of applying the selected models to the **trial** and **test** datasets, including simplification outputs and metric evaluation.

## üîπ Models Used

- **Meta LLaMA 3 ‚Äì 8B parameters**  
  - Used for both trial and test runs with two prompting strategies: *Reinforced* and *Slightly Reinforced*.  
  - Official model: [Meta LLaMA 3 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama)  

- **Ettin ‚Äì Decoder (400M)**  
  - Used as an additional baseline model for simplification.  
  - Official models: [Ettin Suite on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/jhu-clsp/encoders-vs-decoders-the-ettin-suite-686303e16142257eed8e6aeb)  

‚ö†Ô∏è Model weights are **not included** in this repository due to size restrictions.  
Instead, notebooks show how they were loaded and used for inference and evaluation.
