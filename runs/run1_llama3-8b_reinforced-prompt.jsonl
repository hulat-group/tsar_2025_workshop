In the wild, some rare species have trouble finding partners and breeding because of poachers, habitat loss, and predators. A good zoo provides a safe space for these animals to live and breed.

Zoos help by breeding animals in a controlled environment. These zoo-bred animals can then be released back into the wild to increase genetic diversity.","target_cefr":"B1"}
