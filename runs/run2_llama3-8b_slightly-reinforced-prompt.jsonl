This type of dreaming, called lucid dreaming, means you know you're dreaming and can make choices to change what's happening in your dream.

Instead of just trying to figure out what your dreams mean, you'll actually be creating them yourself. However, it's also nice to have some dreams where your subconscious can share its thoughts with you.","target_cefr":"B1"}

The song 'Downbound Train' tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. It's easy to imagine that the artist is drawing from real-life experiences or what could have been if he hadn't become famous. This album shows off the incredible talent of Bruce Springsteen, also known as the Boss.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"108-b1","simplified":"Lewis wants to see more marine protected areas in the world. He thinks this would help fix the harm that humans are causing by overfishing, polluting, and littering. Lewis has seen the damage himself on his adventures. He's swum over coral reefs that have turned white because of rising water temperatures. He's also seen underwater deserts in the Red Sea with no life and lots of plastic waste. Pugh thinks nature can recover if we give it a chance, but time is running out. If we don't take care of our oceans, we might soon face a big problem that's hard to solve.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"109-b1","simplified":"Terrie Sharp is a well-known author who has written many successful books. She has even won an award for her crime stories twice! Growing up in Glasgow, she had to be careful and keep out of trouble because where she lived was known for having high levels of crime. As a result, she learned some important skills, like how to open car doors safely. But she never used these skills for bad things - instead, she used them as inspiration for her novels. Now, Terrie is not so shy and enjoys sharing her stories with others by appearing on TV shows and speaking at writing events all over the UK.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"110-b1","simplified":"Is life getting better or worse? Can we really make progress? Steven Pinker thinks about this big question in his book 'Enlightenment Now'. He says that, overall, things are going well. We're living longer, healthier lives, and we have more freedom and happiness. But the real problem is that some people are attacking important values like using our brains to think critically and relying on science. When leaders and politicians try to get us to be loyal only to our own group, or make us feel hopeless about the future, it's a big danger. If we're not careful, this could cause serious harm to things like democracy and working together as a global community.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"111-b1","simplified":"In old horror movies, characters were often in trouble and couldn't get help or call the police because they didn't have phones. This made the situation seem more realistic. Now that we all have mobile phones, it's harder to make a scary movie believable. So, filmmakers use a trick: no phone signal! If you're the hero of a horror film, you can be sure that when you really need help, your phone won't work or will run out of battery just as you're trying to call for assistance.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"112-b1","simplified":"In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were facing a big problem. Their most profitable type of banana, called Gros Michel or Big Mike, was dying out. Now, the same thing is happening to its replacement, the Cavendish banana. The Gros Michel banana plant used to be very successful because it had fruit that was easy to transport and tasted sweet. Its thick skin made it less likely to get damaged during transportation. United Fruit, a big company that grew and exported bananas in South America at the time, found ways to grow more bananas quickly and efficiently. They did this by taking cuttings from banana plants instead of growing them from seeds, and planting them close together in fields.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"113-b1","simplified":"Most spiders have venom that helps them catch their food or kill it. It's not meant to hurt humans. In fact, only 25 out of all known spider species can actually harm us. Even then, most spider bites are just painful and rarely serious. Australia has a famous spider called the Sydney funnel-web spider. Since they developed an antidote in 1981, there have been no deaths from this spider's bite. However, it's still important to be careful around hairy spiders like tarantulas. If you disturb them or make them feel threatened, they can release tiny hairs that get stuck in your skin or eyes. These hairs are very irritating and can cause discomfort.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"114-b1","simplified":"This type of horror movie is very common. It starts with a group of teenagers having fun, but ends with everyone dying except one girl. At first, this girl is usually shy and not strong. But by the end, she becomes super brave and clever. In most cases, this last girl survives and wins in the end.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"115-b1","simplified":"To understand where our ability to speak complex sentences comes from, we need to look at how our brains differ from those of other animals. It's not just about brain size; it's also important what else our brains can do and when these abilities evolved. Unfortunately, there aren't many physical clues left by our ancestors that would tell us what language they were capable of speaking. However, we can learn something from the remains of early humans. For example, we can see how their mouths, throats, and tongues developed over time. By around 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before then, scientists can only make educated guesses about whether early humans communicated using simpler sounds or not.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"116-b1","simplified":"Society tells us that girls should focus on arts and humanities, while boys are better suited for maths and physics. This is because there aren't many inspiring female role models who work in science-related fields. In cartoons and stories, we often see male characters as scientists, inventors, or astronauts. Unfortunately, the media also portrays scientists as awkward, socially awkward, or isolated from the rest of the world. These stereotypes are not true, but they might discourage girls from pursuing a career in science. If there were more positive female role models in science, it would give girls more confidence and make them feel like they belong in those subjects.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"117-b1","simplified":"The Scallion newspaper comes out every week and is given away for free in university buildings. It's read by around 10,000 students. The good thing about this paper is that it's written and made entirely by students themselves. A survey shows that most students and staff really like the newspaper because it provides entertainment, helps them learn more about different cultures, and gives them work experience. However, printing all these newspapers costs a lot of money. Another problem is that some students can't easily get their hands on a copy because they have to physically go to the university to pick one up. To make things worse, many copies end up littering the campus.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"118-b1","simplified":"At Girox Foods, we're seeing a significant number of our staff leave each year - around 12% of our total workforce. While this might not seem like a lot at first, it's actually higher than what's normal in our industry, where the average is about 7%. The main goal of this report is to figure out why some employees aren't fully engaged with their work and what we can do to make the workplace more enjoyable for them. By understanding these reasons, we hope to come up with suggestions that will help us keep our staff happy and reduce the number of people who leave each year.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"119-b1","simplified":"A lot of what the speaker said makes sense to me. I think it's true that being more connected can make us feel more alone. This isn't a big problem for my age group, who grew up without technology and know how to be by ourselves. We're comfortable with silence and understand that it's okay to have some time to yourself. However, younger people under 20 are different. They're so busy texting and messaging that they never get used to being alone and might miss out on learning to enjoy their own company. Additionally, they learn how to communicate through messages that can be changed, which means they don't develop the skill of having real conversations with someone in front of them.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"120-b1","simplified":"When you give someone praise, it's better not to follow it with criticism.

Don't feel like you need to find something wrong to say.","target_cefr":"B1"}
