# 📊 Results

This folder contains the outputs and evaluation metrics of our runs for the **TSAR 2025 Shared Task**.  
It is divided into two main components: **simplifications** (system outputs) and **metrics** (quantitative evaluation).

---

## 📝 Simplifications

- `trial_simplifications.jsonl` → system outputs for the **trial set**.  
- `test_simplifications.jsonl` → system outputs for the **test set**.  
- Additional runs included in [`../runs/`](../runs/).

Each file follows the shared task format (`id`, `original`, `simplified`).

## 📐 Metrics

We report evaluation results across several metrics:  

- **CEFR Compliance**: Weighted F1, Adjacent Accuracy, Exact match, RMSE  
- **Meaning Preservation**: MeaningBERT, BERTScore  
- **Similarity to References**: MeaningBERT, BERTScore  
- **AlignScore**
